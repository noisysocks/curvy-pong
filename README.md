# Pong

A little curvy pong game that you can totally play in your browser.

Use the arrow keys to control your bat on the left. Strike the ball when your
bat has some speed to make the ball curve up or down. Yell at your robot
opponent to throw it off its game.

## Running

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then open `index.html`. Changes will be compiled automatically, just hit reload
in your browser!

## Building

```
npm run build
```

`dist/pong.js` will then be in a state suitable for production usage. This file
should be commited, seeing as we're using GitHub to host everything.
