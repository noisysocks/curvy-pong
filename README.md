# noisysocks-pong

A little curvy pong game to replace my otherwise boring homepage.

## Running

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then open `index.html`. Changes will be compiled automatically, just hit reload
in your browser!

## Building

```
npm run build
```

`dist/pong.js` will then be in a state suitable for production usage. This file
should be commited, seeing as we're using GitHub to host everything.
